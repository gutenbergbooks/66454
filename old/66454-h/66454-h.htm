<h3>
I
</h3>

<p>
I first met Mr. Baxter at the fourpenny
box outside Mr. Timpenny's second-hand
bookshop in High Street, and was
attracted at once by the loving care with
which he handled its contents.  Dirty
and dog's-eared as most of them were,
he never snatched one up or threw it
down, after the common fashion of
patrons of inexpensive literature, but
would gently extract a more than
usually disreputable volume from its heap,
blow the dust off, straighten the warped
cover, and smooth out the wrinkled
pages before dipping into the subject-matter.
In fact, the last operation struck
me as interesting him least of all.
</p>

<p>
Becoming aware of my presence, he
moved aside with a courtly little bow.
He was a dusty old gentleman, in a very
shabby frock-coat.  He looked as if he
lived in the fourpenny box himself.
</p>

<p>
"Am I preventing you from selecting
a volume, sir?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
I hastened to reassure him.  I had no
special designs on the fourpenny box, or
indeed on any.  I was merely idling.
</p>

<p>
"I am waiting for the druggist to make
up a prescription," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Then you don't do your own dispensing, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"As a rule, yes.  I have run out of this
particular drug, though.  But you know me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; by sight.  We do not take
long in Broxborough to get to know
every one by sight.  You succeeded to
Dr.  Wiseman's practice, I think?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"A good old man, sir, and a lover of
books, like myself."
</p>

<p>
"You're right about yourself," I said.
"You handle a book as I would a
delicate patient."
</p>

<p>
"A very apt comparison, sir.  To me,
in a manner of speaking, a book is a
human thing.  A dilapidated book is a
patient; I like to repair its broken back
and gum in its loose pages.  In fact, the
late Archdeacon used to rally me upon
the subject, sir.  He insisted that I cared
more for a book, as a book, than for
what was inside it."
</p>

<p>
I ventured, with immediate success,
to draw him out upon the subject of the
late Archdeacon.
</p>

<p>
"Archdeacon Belford, sir.  He died
many years ago, and few remember him
now.  A great scholar and gentleman.  I
was associated with him almost
continuously in my younger days.  It was
he who assisted me to found my library."
</p>

<p>
"Your library?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."  The old gentleman's mild
blue eyes suddenly glowed with pride.
"Nothing very pretentious, of course;
but I take my little pleasure in it.  And
it grows&mdash;it grows."  He picked a small
tattered volume out of the box&mdash;it
looked like an ancient school
prize&mdash;and turned down a few dog's-ears with a
distressed expression.
</p>

<p>
"A sweet little edition," he said,
examining the text, "but small print.  I
have left my glasses at home.  Would
you very kindly indicate to me the
nature of its contents, sir?"
</p>

<p>
I read a few lines aloud to him&mdash;poetry.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know it," I confessed.
"Poetry is not much in my line.  Let me
look at the title-page.  Ah&mdash;Robert
Southey."
</p>

<p>
"I rather thought it was Southey,"
said Mr. Baxter immediately.
</p>

<p>
"I fancy you are more widely read
than I am," I remarked.
</p>

<p>
"I make a point of reading aloud a
passage out of one of my books every
day, sir.  I acquired the habit under the
late Archdeacon.  We read together
constantly.  He had very definite views on
the value of reading.  'A man with
books about him,' he used to say, 'is a
man surrounded by friends far more
interesting and distinguished than any he
is likely to meet when he dines with the
Bishop.  A man with a library of his
own, however small, is at once a capitalist
who can never go bankrupt and an
aristocrat who moves in circles to which
the common herd cannot penetrate.  In
other words, a man with a library is a
man respected!'  That was why I founded
my own, sir.  The Archdeacon himself
contributed the first few volumes."
</p>

<p>
"Is it a large library?" I asked,
glancing furtively at my wrist-watch.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir; of very modest dimensions.
But it is sufficiently large to be utilized
by nearly all my friends."
</p>

<p>
"You lend them books, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, sir.  I would not do that.
My books are everything to me&mdash;and
you know what book-borrowers are!
My friends are welcome to tap my
literary resources, but it must be through
me as medium."
</p>

<p>
"I don't quite understand," I said,
noting out of the corner of my eye that
Mr. Pettigrew, the druggist next door,
had emerged from behind the carved
wooden screen which masks the mysteries
of his dispensing department from
the layman's eye, and was now visible
through the shop window, busy with
white paper and sealing-wax.
</p>

<p>
"When a seeker after knowledge calls
upon me," explained the indefatigable
Mr. Baxter, "I select from my library
the appropriate volume and read, or
recite, to him such passages as appear to
me most applicable to his case.  In this
way I ensure the safety and cleanliness
of my literary property&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"So here you are!  I thought so.  Have
you been buying another of those dirty
things?"
</p>

<p>
A small, alert, slightly shrewish girl
of about fifteen had suddenly appeared
from nowhere, and was now transfixing
my flinching companion with the eye of
the Ancient Mariner.
</p>

<p>
"Only fourpence, my dear," replied
Mr. Baxter deferentially.
</p>

<p>
"That's right.  Throw money about!"
said the young lady.  "Have you got
fourpence?" she added, with a slight
softening of manner.
</p>

<p>
"Well, to be exact, I rather think all I
have at the moment is threepence."
</p>

<p>
The Ancient Mariner produced a penny.
</p>

<p>
"Here you are," she said, handing
him the coin with a not altogether
successful attempt at an indulgent smile.
"You haven't bought anything for a
fortnight.  Go in and pay for it, and
then come home to dinner, do!"
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Mr. Baxter!  How's
the library this morning?"
</p>

<p>
The druggist was standing in his doorway,
with a facetious twinkle in his eye.
Evidently Mr. Baxter's library was an
accepted target for local humour.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Baxter took no notice, but disappeared
into the bookshop.  Mr. Pettigrew
handed me my bottle.
</p>

<p>
"One of our characters, that old fellow,"
he said, with that little air of civic
pride which marks the country-townsman
booming local stock.  "Quite a poor
man, but possesses an extensive library&mdash;<i>quite</i>
extensive.  His learning is at
the service of his fellow-citizens.  He
likes to be called The Oracle.  Supposing
you want to know something about
Shakespeare, or Julius Cæsar, or Wireless
Telegraphy, or Patagonia, you go to
Baxter.  You press the button and he
does the rest!  Lives a bit in the clouds,
of course; and I wouldn't go so far as
to say that his information is always
infallible.  In fact"&mdash;Mr. Pettigrew
tapped his forehead significantly&mdash;"his
upper storey&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Who made up a wrong prescription,
and poisoned a baby?" demanded an
acid voice immediately under the
humourist's elbow.  He swung round.  The
small girl, crimson with wrath, but with
her emotions well under control, stood
gazing dispassionately before her,
apparently talking to herself.
</p>

<p>
"Whose wife gave a party," she
continued&mdash;"and nobody came?  Whose
daughter wants to marry the
curate&mdash;and he won't?  Who&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That'll do," announced Mr. Pettigrew,
shortly, and retired in disorder into
his shop.  Simultaneously The Oracle
emerged from the bookshop with Robert
Southey under his arm, and with a
stately inclination in my direction
departed down the street, under the grim
and defiant escort of his infant guardian.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap02"></a></p>

<h3>
II
</h3>

<p>
One morning about three months later,
my butler, footman, valet-de-chambre,
chauffeur, and general supervisor,
McAndrew, thrust his head round the
dining-room door as I sat at breakfast
and announced:
</p>

<p>
"There's a wee body in the hall."
</p>

<p>
I have known McAndrew for seven
years now, and I understand his
vernacular.  We met in that great rendezvous
of all time, the Western Front, on a
day when I took command of a Field
Ambulance in which McAndrew was
functioning as a stretcher-bearer.  When
our unit was demobilized in Nineteen
Nineteen, McAndrew came before me
and announced that he had relinquished
all intention of resuming his former
profession of "jiner" in his native
Dumbarton, and desired henceforth to serve
me in the capacity mentioned above for
the joint term of our natural lives.  I
took him on, and he does very well.  He
has his own ideas about how to wait at
table, and his methods with unauthenticated
callers are apt to be arbitrary;
but he is clean and honest, and&mdash;well,
he wears a vertical gold stripe on his
left sleeve and three ribbons just above
his watch-pocket.  That is enough for me.
</p>

<p>
As I say, his vernacular now contains
no mysteries for me.  So when he made
the alarming announcement just
mentioned I realized at once that no case
of infant mortality had occurred on my
premises, but that a person of small
stature desired an interview.
</p>

<p>
"Man or woman?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"A lassie."
</p>

<p>
"A patient?"
</p>

<p>
"I couldna say: she wouldna tell me,"
replied McAndrew, not without bitterness.
</p>

<p>
"Bring her in," I said.  Forthwith the
Ancient Mariner was ushered into my presence.
</p>

<p>
"Grampa's in bed with one of his legs
again," she announced.
</p>

<p>
I forbore to ask an obvious and
fatuous question, and nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Dr. Wiseman used to attend him,"
continued my visitor; "but he didn't
charge him very much&mdash;next to nothink,
almost," she added, with a shade
of anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"Is your grandfather insured, or on
any club?" I asked.  "If so, the panel
doctor&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, he isn't insured, or anything.
He's a gentleman.  He has a liberry."
</p>

<p>
Toujours the Liberry!  "Where does
he live?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-One, The Common.  When
can you come?"
</p>

<p>
"Eleven o'clock."
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Don't be earlier than that:
I have the room to straighten."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The Home of The Oracle proved to be
one of a row&mdash;something between a
villa and a cottage.  The door was
opened by my sharp-featured little
friend.
</p>

<p>
"Walk in," she said&mdash;"and wipe
your boots."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Baxter was in bed in the front
parlour.  As I had suspected, he had
both legs with him&mdash;but one of these
was inflamed and swollen.
</p>

<p>
"I always bring him in here when he's
poorly," explained the granddaughter
(whose name I discovered later to be
Ada Weeks), "because he likes to be
with his old books."  She favoured her
patient with an affectionate glare.  "He's
half silly about them."
</p>

<p>
I attended to the invalid's immediate
wants, and then overhauled him
generally.  He was not what an insurance
agent would have termed "a good life."  After
that, I was introduced to the library,
which occupied the wall opposite
to the bed.  It consisted of a couple of
mahogany bookcases, of solid Victorian
workmanship, with locked glass doors
lined with faded green silk.  Ada Weeks
produced a key from under her grandfather's
pillow and unlocked one of the
doors, revealing the books.  They were
all neatly covered in brown paper.  There
were no titles on the backs, but each
book bore a number, in sprawling,
irregular figures.
</p>

<p>
"There, sir!" announced my patient,
with simple pride.  "There you behold
the accumulated wealth of a man who is
just as wealthy as he wishes to be!"
</p>

<p>
"Rats!" remarked a sharp voice from
the recesses of the library; but the old
gentleman appeared not to hear.
</p>

<p>
"It dates from the lamented death of
the late Archdeacon.  There are a
hundred and seventy-nine volumes in all.
The little Southey is the last arrival.
Show it to us, Ada."
</p>

<p>
Miss Weeks extracted Volume One
Hundred and Seventy-Nine from the
lowest shelf, and handed it to the old
man.  He turned over the pages lovingly.
</p>

<p>
"Here is the passage which made us
acquainted, sir," he said.  "A delightful
thing."  He produced spectacles from
somewhere in the bed, adjusted them,
and read:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>My days among the Dead are passed:<br />
  Around me I behold<br />
  (Where'er these casual eyes are cast)<br />
  The mighty minds of old:<br />
  My never-failing friends are they,<br />
  With whom&mdash;With whom&mdash;</i>"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
He faltered.
</p>

<p>
"'<i>With whom I converse day by day</i>,'"
said Ada Weeks in a matter-of-fact
voice.  "Don't strain your eyes."
</p>

<p>
"You are right, my dear," admitted
Mr. Baxter, laying down the book.
"The type is somewhat small.  But this
little poem is strangely suggestive of my
own condition.  It is called 'The
Scholar'&mdash;just about an old man living in the
past among his books.  I have read it to
myself many a time since last I saw you,
sir.  Put it back, Ada; and show the
Doctor an older friend.  Something out
of the late Archdeacon's library&mdash;say
Number Fourteen."
</p>

<p>
Miss Ada pulled down the volume
indicated, blew viciously upon the top
edges, and handed it to me.  It proved to
be part of an almost obsolete Encyclopædia.
</p>

<p>
"A useful little compendium of
knowledge," was Mr. Baxter's comment.
"Unfortunately, I have not the set
complete&mdash;only eight volumes.  They
go as far as <i>Pocahontas</i>.  There are four
more, really."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Prairie Oyster to Zymotic</i>," confirmed
the ever-ready Miss Weeks.
</p>

<p>
"Precisely.  You would be surprised
at the number of my callers who desire
information on matters that come
between <i>Prairie Oyster</i> and <i>Zymotic</i>!"  The
old gentleman sighed.  "But where their
requirements are limited to the earlier
letters of the alphabet, I can usually find
a passage which both interests and
enlightens them."   He glanced at the
number on the back of the book.  "This
is the first volume of the set&mdash;<i>A&mdash;Byzantium</i>.
Many a hungry soul have I
fed from it."   He turned over the pages.
"<i>Addison&mdash;Algebra&mdash;Archæology&mdash;Adenoids</i>&mdash;  That
reminds me, a neighbour
is coming in to consult me about
adenoids this afternoon.  A mother&mdash;a
woman in quite humble circumstances.
I must look up adenoids."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't that rather trespassing on my
department?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear! no, sir.  All I shall do will
be to find the passage relating to
adenoids, and read it aloud to Mrs. Caddick."
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Caddick?  I am treating a child
of hers for adenoids at present."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so, sir.  And Mrs. Caddick
naturally wishes to know what they are.
I shall read aloud to her the scientific
definition of the ailment.  It is surprising
what a comfort that will be to her.  Poor
soul, she's almost illiterate; and the
printed word is a sacred mystery to such!"
</p>

<p>
"You are an authority on human
nature, Mr. Baxter, I perceive."
</p>

<p>
"You are kind to say so, sir.  But I
was a mere disciple of the late
Archdeacon.  It's a strange thing, human
nature," he continued pensively.  "I
have studied it all my life.  My
recreation is to help it&mdash;and it needs all the
help it can get.  I am at home every
evening, and folk look in quite regularly
to ask for my guidance on some literary,
historical, or scientific point of interest.
'Consulting The Oracle,' they are kind
enough to call it.  Such visits enable me
to gratify at once my hobby and my
vanity!"  He smiled.
</p>

<p>
"You have one or two bulky-looking
volumes up there," I said, approaching
the bookcase and inspecting the top
shelf.  "Who is this big fellow&mdash;Number
Eighty-Seven?"
</p>

<p>
I half raised my hand; but in a flash
Ada Weeks was before me.
</p>

<p>
"It's Shakespeare," she announced,
snatching the volume down and holding
it to her flat little bosom.  "Presentation!"
</p>

<p>
"Ada is always a little jealous about
letting the presentation volumes out of
her hands," explained Mr. Baxter, from
the bed.  "That book was conferred
upon me as a small token of esteem by a
certain literary circle in London in which
I was interested before I came here,
many years ago.  Bring it to me, my dear."
</p>

<p>
Ada Weeks, with a sidelong and defiant
glance in my direction, handed the
great book to the old man.  He opened it
at random, and began to read aloud.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "This fortress built by Nature for herself<br />
  Against infection and the hand of war,<br />
  This happy breed of men, this little world,<br />
  This precious stone set in a silver sea,<br />
  This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
He broke off, and smiled.
</p>

<p>
"You see I do not need glasses," he
said, "for such a passage as that!  I
almost know it by heart, although I
never possessed the Archdeacon's
astonishing facility in that direction.  He
was accustomed to commit a passage
to memory every day.  Put it back,
Ada, dear."
</p>

<p>
Miss Weeks restored the volume to
the case, closed the door, turned the key,
and faced me with the air of a small but
determined hen which has safely shut
her chickens into the coop in the very
face of an ill-disposed but inexperienced
young fox.  I took up my hat.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Mr. Baxter," I said.  "I
shall come and see you to-morrow.
Don't let your disciples overtire you."
</p>

<p>
The old man flushed.  "I thank you
for that flattering word, sir," he said.
</p>

<p>
Halfway down the street I realized
that I had forgotten my stethoscope.
Accordingly, I retraced my steps.
</p>

<p>
I found the front door open.  I might
have walked in without ceremony; but,
inspired by a very proper fear of Miss
Ada Weeks, I tapped respectfully and
waited.  There was no response.
Presently I became aware of voices proceeding
from the front parlour, the door of
which stood wide open just inside the
passage.  This is what I heard.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Adenitis</i>, and <i>Adenoid Growths</i>&mdash;that's
the nearest I can find.  Which do
you want?"
</p>

<p>
"I think <i>Adenoid Growths</i>, my dear.
Read it through once, as usual; then
again line by line."
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Pay attention, mind!"
said Miss Weeks sharply, and began:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Adenoid Growths of the lym&mdash;lymphatic
tissues of the upper throat occur
chiefly in children from four to fourteen</i>.
Yes, that's right: Johnny Caddick is
eight.  <i>The child breathes through the
mouth</i>&mdash;Where do they expect him to
breathe through?  His ear?&mdash;<i>suffers
from Nasal Cat</i>&mdash;cat something; we'll
call it cater&mdash;<i>from Nasal Cater</i>.  I
wonder how people can write such words,
let alone read them!"
</p>

<p>
"To me," said the gentle voice of the
old man, "it seems wonderful that they
should be able to do either."
</p>

<p>
"Listen again," commanded Miss
Weeks, oblivious of a resounding knock
from me.
</p>

<p>
"<i>&mdash;Nasal Cater, and slight deafness;
and is stupid and sluggish</i>&mdash;  This book
takes off Johnny Caddick to the life, and
no mistake!  I wonder what his mother
will say&mdash;with a <i>cha-rac-ter-is-tic</i>&mdash;oh,
crumbs!&mdash;<i>facial expression.  Cure
is effected by a simple operation of removal</i>.
Does that mean his face?  A good job if
it does!  That's all.  Now I'll learn you
it.  <i>Adenoid Growths&mdash;</i>"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Adenoid Growths; Adenoid Growths;
Adenoid Growths&mdash;</i>"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Of the lymphatic tissues&mdash;</i>"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Of the lymphatic tissues&mdash;</i>"
</p>

<p>
I recollected that I had a spare
stethoscope at home, and tiptoed down the
steps.
</p>

<h3>
III
</h3>

<p>
I learned a good deal about the Baxter
<i>ménage</i> during the next few weeks, from
various sources.
</p>

<p>
First the Rector, whom I encountered
one day paying a parochial call at
Twenty-One, The Common.  We walked
home together.
</p>

<p>
"He's a strange old fellow," said my
companion, "and most of his characteristics
are derived from imitations, conscious
or unconscious, of a stranger old
fellow still."
</p>

<p>
"The late lamented?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  Old Belford was a bachelor,
and lived alone among his books in his
house in the Close for nearly forty years.
His only companions were an aged
cook-housekeeper and Adam Baxter.  He died
fifteen or twenty years ago, before I
came here.  He was nearly ninety, I
fancy."
</p>

<p>
"What was Baxter's exact status in
the household?"
</p>

<p>
"By his own account, he was the old
man's confidential secretary, amanuensis,
and librarian.  My own belief is that
he cleaned the Archidiaconal boots.  Of
course he may have been allowed to dust
the books in the library too.  Anyhow,
during his period of service in that
household he contrived to amass an
enormous quantity of more or less
useless book-learning.  He is regarded
hereabouts as quite a savant.  His erudition
makes him respected by those who have
none, and his library of miscellaneous
rubbish gives him the status of a man of
property."
</p>

<p>
"It's not all rubbish.  He has a
Shakespeare and a Southey, at least.
He has Jowett's Thucydides too, he tells me."
</p>

<p>
"You're right: I retract that part.
But his library is rubbish, in the sense
that it's an unclassified rag-bag of odds
and ends.  Still, he's an enlightened old
chap in his way.  When he settled down
in that little house after old Belford's
death and began to set up as a sort of
provincial Socrates, his conversation and
library were mainly classical, as you
might expect, considering their origin.
He would pull down a Homer, or a
Herodotus, or a Vergil, and spout to his
audience some favourite passage of his
late employer."
</p>

<p>
"You mean to say he translated from
the original Latin and Greek?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  That's what nobody knows.
The peculiar thing about Baxter is that,
though he will read or quote from any
book in his library for your delectation,
he practically never permits any one to
take the book out of his hands.  No
human eye, for instance, has ever fallen
upon the printed pages of Baxter's
Homer.  If it did, I suspect it would find
that page printed in good plain English.
Pope's translation, probably."
</p>

<p>
"You think he is a fraud, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, bless you, no!  I think he is
a genuine book-lover, and values&mdash;in
fact lives on&mdash;the respect which his
literary eminence earns for him in this
extremely unliterary township.  But
candidly I think most of his classical
works are common cribs.  I have known
less pardonable forms of hypocrisy.
But I was saying just now he was
enlightened.  Of late years he has
supplemented his Latin and Greek and his
Poets and Historians by scientific and
technical literature.  People go and
consult him about all sorts of modern
developments and tendencies now."
</p>

<p>
"Adenoids, for instance?"
</p>

<p>
"Precisely.  Well, I turn off here.  I
am going to pay a call upon a gentleman
who made a large fortune out of
Civilian War Work of National Importance.
<i>He</i> has acquired a library, too&mdash;quite
recently and all at once&mdash;beautifully
bound in morocco and tree calf.  But I
doubt if he could quote a single line from
a single volume therein.  Baxter for me,
every time!  Good-afternoon."
</p>

<p>
Secondly, from McAndrew.
</p>

<p>
"Yon auld felly, Baxter," he suddenly
remarked to me one day while driving
me home from a professional round, and
passing the door of Number Twenty-One;
"he's real respeckit in the toon.
In Scotland, of course, he would be
naebody, for every one's educatit there.
But here there's men making as much
as seeven pound a week at the Phoenix
Linoleum Works, on the south side, that
has read naething since they passed
through school but the Sabbath
newspapers.  They look on Baxter as a kin'
o' Cyclopedy.  <i>But</i>&mdash;I was in there the
other nicht for a bit crack, and I asked
him what he thought of Rabbie Burns.
<i>He'd never heard tell of him</i>!  There's
your Oracle!"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Baxter is a self-made man of
letters," I said.  "He got most of his
learning second-hand from the
Archdeacon.  Perhaps the Archdeacon was
not a student of Burns, either."
</p>

<p>
The enormity of this suggestion quite
paralyzed McAndrew for a while.  Presently
he recovered sufficiently to resume:
"Yon Archdeacon was a doited sort of
body.  He lived all alone in yon
dreich-lookin' house in the Cathedral Close
nigh fufty year.  He had naething aboot
him but books, and naebody aboot him
but an auld wife, Mistress Corby, and
Baxter.  She's deid now, but her
dochter married on the ironmonger in High
Street.  It was her was telling me.
Mistress Corby did the beds and the
cooking, and Baxter did everything else.  He
redd up the library, and dusted the
books.  He carried the coals and sorted
the garden as weel.  And where do you
think the Archdeacon got him?"
</p>

<p>
"Baxter?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, Baxter.  <i>Singin' in the street</i>!
There's few fowk in this toon ken that,
or mind it.  But Baxter just drufted into
the place one wet day, with the toes
stickin' oot of his boots, and the
Archdeacon found him standin' in the rain
and took him intil the hoose and kept
him.  Twenty-five shillin' a week he got,
with two suits of clothes a year and a bit
present at Christmas.  He bided there
thirty years, and the Archdeacon never
repented of his bargain.  Good servants
is scarce."
</p>

<p>
McAndrew paused impressively, to allow
this last truth to sink in, and continued.
</p>

<p>
"I jalouse the way Baxter got an so
weel with the Archdeacon was the interest
he took in the library.  He was never
oot of it, unless he was pitten oot.  It
wasna so much that he would read the
books as worship them.  He would take
them oot and hold them in his hands
by the hour, or sit back on a chair and
glower at their backs on the shelves.  So
Mistress Corby's dochter that married
on the ironmonger tellt me."
</p>

<p>
"By the way, when did Mr. Baxter's
granddaughter appear on the scene?"
I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"That was long after the old man
died.  He left Baxter an annuity, with
two bookcases and a wheen books to
start a library of his ain.  Mistress
Corby's dochter says he left him fufty,
and Baxter pinched other twenty-five.
That was the nucleus, you'll understand.
The rest he has been collecting
for himself for many a year."
</p>

<p>
"And the granddaughter?" I inquired gently.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, aye; I was coming to her.  She
came along aboot five years ago, long
after the old man had settled into yon
wee hoose where he stays now.  She
just appeared.  Naebody could ever
find oot where from, although Mistress
Corby's dochter asked Baxter to tea in
her own hoose twice and called on him
herself three times.  Baxter is as close
as an oyster, and as for the
lassie"&mdash;McAndrew shuddered slightly&mdash;"she
has an ill tongue tae provoke."
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, <i>chez</i> Baxter.
</p>

<p>
As already indicated, it was the old
gentleman's custom of an evening to
receive visitors in the front room and
discourse to them on literature, poetry,
history, and science.  Light
refreshments&mdash;very light refreshments&mdash;were
handed round by Miss Weeks; but
these were a mere appendage to the
literary provender supplied.  I formed
the habit of joining this symposium upon
one evening every week&mdash;at first out
of idle curiosity (and perhaps with the
pardonable desire of indulging in one of
the few forms of advertisement open to a
struggling physician), but subsequently
through sheer interest in the academy
itself and the amazingly sure touch with
which the master handled his disciples.
</p>

<p>
They were a motley crew.  There were
socially ambitious young shop-assistants,
anxious to acquire a literary polish
likely to impress the opposite sex.  There
were artisans who wished to advance
themselves in the technique of their
profession.  There were heavy-handed,
heavy-shouldered, rather wistful men,
with muscles made lusty by hard
physical labour, conscious of minds grown
puny and attenuated for lack of
intellectual nourishment.  There were humble
folk with genuine literary leanings, who
came to consult Mr. Baxter's poems and
essays, and sometimes shyly proffered
compositions of their own for perusal
and comment.  There were men&mdash;uneducated
men&mdash;dimly conscious of the
fact that they possessed immortal souls,
who had waded into the deep waters of
theological speculation, and got out of
their depth.  For each and all
Mr. Baxter had a word of welcome and
counsel.
</p>

<p>
"I am very happy to see you,
Mr. Wright.  And your friend, Mr.&mdash;?
Mr. Dennis.  Thank you.  We are going to
read and discuss a passage from 'The
Tempest' presently.  Shakespeare, you
know.  Be seated, and my granddaughter
will offer you a little refreshment....
I have been consulting various authorities
on statical electricity for you,
Mr. Armitage.  I have marked a few
passages in my Encyclopædia, Volume
Twenty in my library, which seem to me
to treat the subject most lucidly.  You
might also derive some information from
the life of Mr. Faraday&mdash;Volume
Eighteen.  My granddaughter will look
up the passage for you presently....
Ah, Mr. Jobson!  How are they down at
the factory to-day?  You are just in time.
We are about to read and discuss a
passage from 'The Tempest.'  Shakespeare,
of course.  Be seated, pray....  For me
to read, Mr. Penton?  Thank you: that
indeed will be an intellectual treat.  I
will peruse your manuscript at leisure,
and comment upon it at our next
meeting....  The Agnostics still bothering
you, Mr. Clamworthy?  Well, I am no
theologian; but for sheer old-fashioned
common sense I don't think you can
beat Paley's 'Evidences of Christianity.'  The
late Archdeacon used to say that he
always came back to Paley in the end.
Ada, my dear, that passage I marked
in Volume Forty-Seven!  Now friends,
'The Tempest'!"
</p>

<p>
After that the Presentation Shakespeare
would be opened, and Mr. Baxter
would declaim selected passages.  His
voice was mellow, and his manner
ecclesiastical; plainly his whole deportment
was moulded, to the last gesture and
inflexion, on one unvarying model.  A
discussion would follow&mdash;a quite naïve
and rather pathetic discussion,
sometimes.  Ultimately Mr. Baxter would
sum up, generally with extracts from
other Shakespearian passages, which he
turned up with great readiness and
dexterity, rolling them from off his tongue
with obvious relish.  Occasionally he
would ask Ada for some other volume,
and read from that.  There were great
moments when he would actually call
for Homer or Horace and, with apologies
for rusty scholarship, offer to our
respectful ears a quite coherent rendering
of some famous passage.
</p>

<p>
Finally, at a moment selected by
herself, the vigilant Ada Weeks would
terminate the proceedings with the curt
announcement that her grandfather was
tired.  The precious volumes were locked
in the library again, and we were bidden,
without ceremony, to say good-night to
our host and not to bang the street door.
Both of which commands we obeyed
promptly and reverently, and departed
homeward.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
IV
</h3>

<p>
Possibly it may have occurred to the
reader to wonder whether in a community
at once so erudite and progressive as
Broxborough&mdash;it possesses both a
Cathedral Close and a Linoleum Factory,
you will remember&mdash;there can have
been no official alternative to Twenty-One,
The Common&mdash;no Public Library,
no Public Lecture Courses, no Municipal
Oracle, as it were.
</p>

<p>
In truth Broxborough once had all
these things.  Before the War there
existed an institution known as
Broxborough Pantheon.  Here was an
excellent library of reference; lectures and
classes, too, were constantly in operation
throughout the winter months.  In its
lighter moments the Pantheon lent itself
to whist drives.  But the entire building
had been destroyed by fire in Nineteen
Fifteen, and had never been rebuilt, for
the good and sufficient reason that
during those days there were other things
to do.  After the Armistice money was
scarce and rates were high.  Moreover,
that shrinking sensitive-plant, the
British bricklayer, had been instructed by
his Union to limit his professional
activities to a tale of bricks so tenuous
that his labours for the day were
completed, without undue strain, by the
time that he knocked off for breakfast.
The months passed; such constructive
energy as the district could compass was
devoted to Government housing schemes,
and still the Pantheon lay in ruins.
</p>

<p>
But one day a man from Pittsburgh,
who had been born in Broxborough
nearly forty years previously, and had
relinquished his domicile and civil status
therein by becoming an American citizen
at the age of three, returned, rugged,
prosperous, and beneficently sentimental,
to revisit the haunts of his youth,
and refresh his somewhat imperfect
memories of his birthplace.
</p>

<p>
Naturally he found the place
profoundly changed.  The Cathedral
organ-bellows were now inflated by a
gas-engine, and the nine-seventeen up-train
did not start until nine-forty-two.
And&mdash;where the Broxborough Pantheon had
once reared its stucco pseudo-Doric
façade upon the market-square, there
was nothing but an untidy hoarding
masking a heap of charred débris, and
labelled, 'Site of proposed new premises
of the Broxborough Pantheon.'  The
label appeared to have been there for
some years.
</p>

<p>
John Crake of Pittsburgh made
inquiries, and the truth was revealed.  The
old Pantheon had ceased to exist for
nearly five years, and the new Pantheon,
in the present condition of the rate-payers'
pockets, seemed unlikely ever to
exist at all.  So John Crake, having
pondered the matter in his large and
sentimental heart, put his hand into his
own capacious pocket, and lo! the new
Pantheon arose.  The plasterers had
wreaked their will upon the donor's
bank account, and were making sullen
way for the plumbers and electricians,
about the time when I first encountered
Mr. Baxter outside the second-hand
bookshop.
</p>

<p>
And now the building was ready for
occupation, and the exact procedure at
the opening ceremony was becoming a
matter of acute recrimination at the
Council meetings.  So that genial gossip
the Rector informed me, as we encountered
one another one afternoon on our
professional rounds.
</p>

<p>
"Things are more or less arranged,"
he said, "so far as our city fathers are
capable of arranging anything.  The
place is to be called Crake Hall, which I
think is right, and Crake himself is
coming over from America for the opening,
which I call sporting of him.  Old
Broxey" (The Most Noble the Marquis
of Broxborough, the Lord Lieutenant of
our County) "will perform the opening
ceremony.  That is to say, he will
advance up the steps in the presence of the
multitude and knock three times upon
the closed doors of the Hall.  A solemn
pause will follow, to work up the
excitement.  Then the donor, who will be
standing inside, wearing a top-hat for
the first time in his life&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Rector, I have frequently warned
you that your ribald tongue will some
day lose you your job."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind that.  It's a poor heart
that never rejoices, and I am too fat to
be serious all the time, anyhow.  Well,
after the appointed interval of silence
Crake will open a kind of peep-hole in
the oaken door, and say: 'Who goes
there?' or something of that kind.
Broxey, if he is still awake, will reply:
'The Citizens of this Ancient Borough,'
or words to that effect.  Then the doors
will be thrown open&mdash;assuming that
they will open; but you know what our
local contractors are&mdash;and Crake will
be revealed in his top-hat, and will say:
'Welcome, Stranger!' or, 'Walk right
in, boys!' or, 'Watch your step!' or
something like that, and will hand the
key of the Institute to Broxey, who will
probably lose it."
</p>

<p>
"I see.  And then to lunch at the
Town Hall, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Not so fast.  Remember this is a
Cathedral city: the Dean and Chapter
must be given an opportunity to put
their oar in.  The Dean will speak his
piece, and then I understand that the
Choir, who are to be concealed
somewhere behind one of the doors, will
create a brief disturbance.  After that the
Town will assert itself, as against the
County and the Close."
</p>

<p>
"What is their stunt going to be?"
</p>

<p>
"An Address of Welcome and Grateful
Thanks to Crake."
</p>

<p>
"That seems reasonable.  But who is
going to compose it?"
</p>

<p>
"I have already done so, by request.
It is not half bad," said the Rector
modestly.
</p>

<p>
"Who is going to read it?  The Mayor?"
</p>

<p>
"The Mayor is an imperfect creature,
but he possesses one superlative quality:
he harbours no illusions about his own
ability to grapple with the letter H.  He
declines to read the Address.  Most of
the Corporation are in the same
boat&mdash;though they don't all admit it."
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you read it yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"Trades-Union rules forbid.  If I read
it, it would be regarded as the
propaganda of the Established Church.  The
forces of Town and Chapel would
combine to fall upon me and crush me.  No,
we must have a citizen&mdash;a citizen of
credit and renown, locally known and
esteemed."   The Rector eyed me
furtively.  "I suppose <i>you</i>, now&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Not on your life!" I replied hastily.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, for one thing I am a comparative
stranger: I haven't been here two
years yet.  Besides, in opening a literary
and intellectual emporium of this kind
you want&mdash;I have it!  The very man!"
</p>

<p>
"Who?" asked the Rector eagerly.
</p>

<p>
I told him.
</p>

<p>
The Rector halted in the middle of
the street and shook me by the hand.
</p>

<p>
"Ideal!" he said.  "I'll fix it with the
Council.  You go and ask <i>him</i>."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
V
</h3>

<p>
I repaired to the Home of The Oracle
that same evening.  It was destined to
be a memorable visit.
</p>

<p>
Something unusual in the atmosphere
impressed itself on my senses the
moment Ada Weeks opened the door to me.
Miss Weeks's manner could never at any
time be described as genial: at its very
best it was suggestive of an indulgent
sergeant-major.  But this evening Ada
resembled a small, lean cat, engaged in a
rear-guard action with dogs.  Her green
eyes blazed: one felt that she would like
to arch her back and spit.
</p>

<p>
"Pettigrew and Mould is here," she
said.  "Hang up your own hat: I can't
leave them."  And she vanished into
the front room.
</p>

<p>
Messrs. Pettigrew and Mould were a
sore trial to Mr. Baxter.  They did not
consult The Oracle regularly, but when
they did they made trouble.  Their
efforts appeared mainly to be directed
towards embarrassing their host by
asking frivolous questions, and then
humiliating him in the presence of his
disciples by the manner in which they
received his answers.
</p>

<p>
The attitude of Mr. Pettigrew, the
druggist, was understandable; for he
was a mean little man, and jealous.  He
possessed diplomas and certificates of
his own: he was steeped in all the
essences of the Pharmacopoeia: yet none
did him reverence.  The townspeople
purchased cough mixtures and patent
pills from him with no more respect than
if they had been sausages or yards of
tape.  Even when he assumed an air of
portentous solemnity and retired behind
his carved oak screen with a prescription,
most of his customers took it for granted
that he filled up the bottle from a
water-tap and added colouring matter and a
dash of something unpleasant to the
taste.  Probably they were not far wrong.
But wrong or right, it never occurred to
any of them to treat Mr. Pettigrew as an
Oracle, or Savant, or Philosopher; and
Mr. Pettigrew undoubtedly felt very
badly about it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mould was our local undertaker&mdash;which
was unfortunate, for nature
had intended him for a low comedian.
Under a professionally chastened
exterior he concealed the sense of humour
and powers of repartee of a small boy
of ten.  To him Mr. Baxter, with his
studied little mannerisms and his
pedantic little courtesies, was fair game.
</p>

<p>
When I entered the parlour these two
worthies were heavily engaged in their
favourite sport of philosopher-baiting.
The philosopher himself, I noticed, was
looking very old and very tired.  I had
not seen him for a week, and I was
secretly shocked at his appearance.
</p>

<p>
"You're not looking well," I said, as I
shook hands.  "You ought not to be
entertaining your friends to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed," replied my host, with the
ghost of a smile, "my friends have been
entertaining me.  Mr. Mould has been
amusing us all.  Has he not, Ada?"
</p>

<p>
"If I was his wife," replied Miss
Weeks, with a glare which would have
permanently disheartened any comedian
less sure of himself than Mr. Mould, "I
should die of laughing&mdash;at myself!"
</p>

<p>
This dark saying was accepted by the
undertaker as a compliment.
</p>

<p>
"I certainly venture to claim," he
observed complacently, "that we pulled
our respected friend's leg pretty neatly
to-night."  Pettigrew sniggered.
</p>

<p>
"What was the joke?" I asked,
without enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"Well, me and Mr. Pettigrew here,"
began the undertaker, "knowing Mr. Baxter's
fondness for giving information
and advice, brought him a little poser
last time we came here.  We asked him
if he could find anything in his library
about an ancient Greek party called
Cinchona.  He said he would look
Mr. Cinchona up.  This evening he had his
little lecture all ready for us.  Highly
enjoyable, it was.  Cinchona, it seems,
was one of the less-known figures in
Ancient Greek Mythology&mdash;wasn't that
it, Pettigrew?"
</p>

<p>
Pettigrew grinned, and clicked.  He
was an unpleasant-looking creature, with
false teeth which did not fit.
</p>

<p>
"In fact," continued Mould, with
immense relish, "poor old Cinchona was
such a little-known figure that most
people&mdash;common uneducated druggists,
like Mr. Pettigrew&mdash;thought Cinchona
was the name of the bark they make
quinine from.  Haw, haw, haw!"
</p>

<p>
The two humourists roared outright
this time.  Mr. Baxter, with the
unruffled courtesy of perfect breeding,
smiled again, though I could see he was
much put out.  Jobson, the heavy-shouldered
artisan from the factory, sat
gazing at him in a puzzled and rather
reproachful manner.  One could see that
he felt his master ought to have known
all about Cinchona.
</p>

<p>
"An interesting coincidence," commented
the old man gently.  "The drug
cinchona is, of course, well known
scientifically, but classically, Cinchona the
demi-god is hardly known at all.  In
fact, he is only mentioned once or twice
in the whole of ancient literature.  I
have been dipping into my Homer"&mdash;he
indicated the familiar volume in his
hand&mdash;"and I find&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"May I look for myself?" asked
Pettigrew suddenly; and before even Ada
could spring to the old man's side he
had snatched the book and opened it.
Baxter put out his hand anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Let me find the passage for you,
Mr. Pettigrew," he said.  "I do not know
whether you are familiar with ancient
Greek&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Mr. Pettigrew grimly,
looking up from the book, "I am not.
But I <i>am</i> familiar with modern German.
This book is printed in German!"
</p>

<p>
"The marginal comments are in
German, of course," said the old man
quickly.  "The thoroughness of German
research is proverbial.  Give me back
the book, pray!"  I noticed he was
breathing very shortly.
</p>

<p>
Ada Weeks settled the question by
wrenching the volume out of Pettigrew's
hand and locking it into The
Liberry.
</p>

<p>
"You can go!" she announced.  "We
only entertain gentlemen here."
</p>

<p>
Pettigrew took up his hat: Mould rose
and did likewise.  The rest of the
company fidgeted uncomfortably in their
seats.  It was a particularly unpleasant
moment.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, Mr. Baxter," said
Pettigrew, moving towards the door, which
Miss Weeks was obligingly holding wide
open for him.  "Sometimes I wonder,"
he sniggered, turning again, "whether
you are quite as ripe a scholar as you
would have some of the less educated
people in this town believe."
</p>

<p>
"Ripe?  He's over-ripe&mdash;rotten!"
announced Mould confidently.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Baxter rose suddenly from his
armchair.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," he said, "you insult me
in my own house.  It is your privilege
to do so.  You are my guests&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I thought it time to interfere.  I
crossed the room, gently lowered my
old friend into his seat again, and turned
to the company.  They were all on their
feet by this time.
</p>

<p>
"Now look here," I announced, in
what I have always hoped is a breezy
voice, "you people really must keep
your debates academic.  Here you are,
all flying straight up in the air over some
twopenny-ha'penny point of scholarship,
and exciting one of my most valued
patients"&mdash;I patted Baxter solemnly
on the shoulder&mdash;"to an attack of
insomnia!  You mustn't do it, you
know&mdash;especially just now!"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, just now?"
asked Ada quickly.  She shot an
apprehensive glance at her grandfather's
drawn features.
</p>

<p>
"I mean this.  You know the opening
of Crake Hall takes place on Saturday?"
</p>

<p>
Every one looked up, surprised at the
diversion.
</p>

<p>
"Yes: what of it?" said Pettigrew.
</p>

<p>
"You know that an Address of Welcome
and Grateful Thanks is to be read
to Mr. Crake by a representative citizen
of the town?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Pettigrew again; and he
said it with an intensity which gave him
away badly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mr. Baxter here&mdash;our very
dear and esteemed friend Mr. Baxter"&mdash;I
spoke the words deliberately, and felt
the old shoulder suddenly stiffen under
my hand&mdash;"has been unanimously
selected by the Council"&mdash;I breathed
a prayer that the Rector might not have
failed me&mdash;"to read that Address!
That is why I am thoroughly angry with
you all for tiring him out with your
conundrums.  He is not a young man, or a
strong man; and I want to have him in
first-class trim for his appearance on
Saturday.  Home to bed, all of you!"
</p>

<p>
"Outside!" commanded Miss Weeks;
and shepherded the entire company into
the passage, closing the door behind her.
</p>

<p>
Baxter and I were left alone.  I took
my stand on the worn hearth-rug, with
my back to the fire, lingering over the
lighting of my pipe with the uneasy
self-consciousness of the Englishman who
has just participated in a scene.  My
old friend's thin hands were extended
upon the arms of his chair; his head was
sunk upon his breast.  I decided to say
something cheerful.
</p>

<p>
"Well," I remarked, "I think the
Council's invitation came to you at a
very appropriate moment."
</p>

<p>
Baxter raised his head, and I noticed
that he seemed to have grown many
years older.
</p>

<p>
"I fear you have done me an ill
service, sir," he said.  "Unintentionally,
of course!" he hastened to add.
</p>

<p>
"In what way?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot accept the Council's invitation."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?  I'll have you fit and well
by Saturday."
</p>

<p>
"It's not that, sir.  I cannot do it."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"Because&mdash;because I happen to be
an impostor!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come!  You must not take things
too much to heart.  A man can be a
sound scholar without knowing very
much about Greek or German."
</p>

<p>
"It's not that, sir."
</p>

<p>
"What, then?"
</p>

<p>
"I can neither read nor write."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>
I mixed a glass of weak whiskey and
water, and made him drink it.  Presently
he began to talk&mdash;in a low voice, with
pauses for breath; but after a while with
a flicker of his old graciousness and dignity.
</p>

<p>
"The late Archdeacon, sir, used to
observe that a man should have no
secrets from his banker, his lawyer, or his
doctor.  (He had a great many from all
three, but no matter!)  I have no banker,
and no lawyer; but I have a doctor&mdash;a
very kind doctor&mdash;and I am going to
tell him something which it is only fair
he should know.
</p>

<p>
"I was born before the days of Free
Education.  I was earning my living in
the streets of London when Mr. Forster
brought in the Bill of Eighteen Seventy.
My circumstances were extremely humble.
I passed the first years of my life
on a canal barge.  (My uncle steered
the barge.  I think he was my uncle.)  It
is difficult to educate children so
reared.  They have no permanent place
of abode; no particular school-district
is responsible for such little vagrants.
So I grew up illiterate.  My uncle died.
I earned my living as best I could.  I
was strong and active: I engaged in
tasks which demanded no knowledge of
letters.  I learned to cipher a little in my
head and to read the ordinary numerals:
but the alphabet remained a mystery
to me."
</p>

<p>
"Why did you not learn to read and write?"
</p>

<p>
"I did try.  At the age of twenty I
determined to master my ignorance.  I
purchased a primer, and endeavoured to
teach myself.  But that task was
hopeless.  I entered a night-school&mdash;and
they asked me what I wished to study.
Languages&mdash;Mathematics&mdash;Science&mdash;Engineering?
How could I, a great
grown man, tell them that I wanted to
learn to read and write?  I hurried out
of the building.
</p>

<p>
"Then I married.  I married a woman
as unlettered as myself.  Whom else
could I ask?  We were happy together,
in our humble way.  But we had few
associates, and such as we had possessed
all our ignorance and none of our
aspirations."
</p>

<p>
"Had you children?"
</p>

<p>
"One daughter&mdash;Ada's mother.  You
may depend upon it we sent <i>her</i> to
school!  And she learnt quickly&mdash;far
too quickly for me.  I had cherished a
hope that my child and I might
commence our education together.  But how
could the muscle-bound intellect of an
illiterate of thirty keep pace with the
nimble wits of a sharp little girl?"
</p>

<p>
The nimble wits of a sharp little girl!
Somehow I seemed to recognize that portrait.
</p>

<p>
"My daughter had passed the goal
almost before her father had started.
Once more, discouraged and baffled, I
relinquished my ambitions: I was a
foolish fellow to have entertained them at
all.  But my child was good to me&mdash;very
good.  Although she possessed neither
the art nor the patience to teach
me my letters, she discovered in me my
one talent&mdash;quite a phenomenal
aptitude for memorization.  Compensation,
probably.  If I heard an ordinary
newspaper article read over once or twice, I
could repeat it word for word without
prompting.  And so to satisfy my hungry
soul I would beg my little daughter to
read aloud to me her school tasks, or her
evening lessons&mdash;elementary history,
geography, and the like.  I never forgot
them: they were the first real learning I
ever possessed.  I can repeat them
still&mdash;and I think they kept me sane.
</p>

<p>
"My daughter grew up; married; had
a daughter of her own; died; and I was
alone again.  Suddenly I perceived that
I had passed middle age.  I was no
longer able-bodied; and I began to realize
that when the body begins to fail, it
is the brain that must carry on.  And I
had no brain&mdash;nothing but a few
instincts and rules of life.  They were
wholesome instincts and healthy rules of
life; but as a means of livelihood they
were valueless.  I began to slip down.
I supported myself by odd and menial
tasks: I cleaned knives and boots: I sold
newspapers which I could not read: I
spent long hours as a night watchman,
occupying my mind by repeating to
myself passages from my little girl's
schoolbooks.
</p>

<p>
"Then came a hard winter: work was
scarce enough for skilled labourers, let
alone unskilled.  As for the illiterate,
there was no market for them at all.  I
tramped from London to try my fortune
elsewhere; and came to Broxborough.
I was destitute: I sang in the streets for
bread&mdash;songs I had learnt by listening
in public houses or at popular
entertainments in my younger days.  And
there the late Archdeacon found me.
I was a stranger, and he took me in."  He
was silent again.
</p>

<p>
"He was very good to you?" I said
presently.
</p>

<p>
"He was an angel from Heaven, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"But didn't he teach you to read?"
</p>

<p>
The old man looked up at me piteously.
</p>

<p>
"Sir, I never confessed to him that I
could not!  And he never found me out!
Why should he?  I was his servant,
engaged on purely domestic duties.  Such
clerical work as dealing with tradesmen
involved was attended to by the
housekeeper.  One day my master asked me if
I had read the Prime Minister's speech,
and I replied that I never read the
newspapers.  I intended the statement to be
a confession, leading up to a fuller
confession; but instead, the good old man
took me to mean that I despised politics
and journalism and was interested only
in philosophy and literature.  From that
day he admitted me to all the privileges
of his literary companionship.  His
favourite hobby was reading aloud&mdash;preferably
passages from the Classics&mdash;and
he had few to read to.  None, in
fact.  I was appointed his audience.
Every evening we sat together and he
read aloud to me, with every kind of
illuminating comment.  My peculiar
faculty for memorization, intensified by the
absence of any other medium of
self-cultivation, enabled me to commit to
memory the greater part of what he read
and said.  At the end of ten years I could
quote long passages from most of the
standard works of literature.  When the
dear old man died, I was a human
fountain of quotations&mdash;poetical, historical,
philosophical.  Just that, and nothing
more.  Once more I had to make a niche
for myself in the world.  My accumulated
lore was my sole asset.  So I took
this little house, and set up my
useless&mdash;because mainly ornamental&mdash;little
library, and endeavoured to win the
respect of my new neighbours by dispensing
an erudition which was in reality
second-hand.  Second-hand, sir!"  He looked
up wistfully.  "Am I an impostor?"
</p>

<p>
"All learning is second-hand," I said.
"You are not an impostor."
</p>

<p>
He rose to his feet, and took my hand.
</p>

<p>
"You have lifted a load from my
mind," he said.  "Confession is good for
the soul.  But you will understand now
why I cannot deliver that Address."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" I repeated.  "I will get a
copy of it for you, and you can learn it
by heart."
</p>

<p>
"You can do that?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly."
</p>

<p>
The colour came back to his face.
</p>

<p>
"The time is short," he said eagerly&mdash;"very
short; and my memory is not what
it was: but I will try.  Ada shall read it
to me, and read it to me, and read it to
me, until I am word-perfect!  I <i>will</i>
succeed!  It will be wonderful!"
</p>

<p>
"It will score off Mould and Pettigrew
too," I added spitefully.
</p>

<p>
But obviously Mr. Baxter was not
thinking of Mould or Pettigrew.  He
was up again in his rightful place, in the
clouds.
</p>

<p>
"It will be my Apotheosis!" he
declared; and brought down his feeble
hand with a gentle thump upon the
table beside him.
</p>

<p>
"That's right!" said Miss Weeks,
entering.  "Break all the cups!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
VII
</h3>

<p>
At the Municipal luncheon which
followed the inauguration of Crake Hall,
one chair was vacant; the Mayor, in his
opening remarks, referring sympathetically
to the fact.  Mr. Baxter, to whom
had fallen the honour of reading the
Address of Welcome to their
distinguished guest that morning, had found
the strain of the proceedings rather too
great for his advanced years, and had
reluctantly begged to be excused from
participating further in the ceremonies
of the day.  In short, Mr. Baxter, his
task completed, had gone home to bed.
Later in the proceedings the Lord
Lieutenant also alluded to the matter.
His Lordship was a statesman of somewhat
limited ideas, and it is just possible
that he was grateful to have had a topic
suggested to him.  So he spoke quite
feelingly of the empty chair&mdash;the chair
which was to have been occupied by
"our eminent fellow-citizen,
Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Buxton."  It was a cheering and
reassuring sign, he continued, of our
national and civic solidity of character and
sense of proportion that Broxborough,
where to the unseeing eye of the
outside world nothing seemed to matter
save linoleum, should yet be able, amid
its manifold industrial activities, to
produce a man&mdash;a man in quite humble
circumstances&mdash;to whom Linoleum was
nothing and Letters everything.
Napoleon had called us a nation of
shopkeepers; but so long as a commercial
community like Broxborough could go on
breeding homespun scholars like
Mr.&mdash;ah&mdash;Dexter, we as a nation could
continue to give the lie to Napoleon.  (Loud
and prolonged applause.)
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the recipient of these
testimonials lay a-dying in his own front
parlour.  Ada Weeks had put him
straight to bed there on his return,
utterly exhausted, from the Inauguration.
All his frail physical powers had been
concentrated for three days on making
himself word-perfect in the Address&mdash;which
he had delivered, by the way,
flawlessly.  Now reaction had come.
An hour later, more nearly frightened
than I had ever seen her, Ada fetched me.
</p>

<p>
My patient had just asked me, faintly
but fearlessly, one of the last questions
that mortal man can ask; and I had
given him his answer.
</p>

<p>
"I am quite ready," he replied calmly.
"I am only seventy-four; but it is well
that a man should go at the zenith of his
career."
</p>

<p>
"Are there any arrangements you
would like to make?" I asked.
"Anything you would like to say?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Is Ada there?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am there!"  The small,
stricken figure crouching on the other
side of the bed put out a skinny paw
and took the old man's hand.  She held
it steadfastly for the rest of the time he
lived.
</p>

<p>
"Would you like to see the Rector?"
I asked.
</p>

<p>
"No, no.  I am at peace with God.  It
is of my little granddaughter that I
would speak."   His voice was stronger
now.  "My annuity dies with me.  I have
some small savings, which she will
receive.  But they will not keep her.  I
shall be grateful if you will exert your
influence, sir, in enabling her to go into
service."
</p>

<p>
"There is a vacancy in my house, if
Ada will come," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you.  Will you go to the
Doctor, Ada?"
</p>

<p>
Ada, with tears running freely at last,
nodded in answer; and the dying man
proceeded to the business which was ever
uppermost in his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"Then, sir, my Library."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  What are you going to do with
it?  Leave it to the town?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no, no, no!" He was strangely
emphatic.
</p>

<p>
"What, then?" I asked.  I had an
uneasy feeling that the Library was
going to be bequeathed to me, and I did
not want it in the least.  But my fears
were relieved at once.
</p>

<p>
"I intend to leave it to Ada&mdash;temporarily."
</p>

<p>
"Temporarily?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  But as she will be an inmate of
your household, she will probably desire
to take you into her confidence, and
possibly avail herself of your assistance."  His
voice failed again; his grip on life
was relaxing rapidly.  Then he recovered
himself, and almost sat up.
</p>

<p>
"Will you promise me, sir, to assist
Ada to carry out my wishes with regard
to the disposal&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I promise," I said.  "Don't exhaust
yourself."
</p>

<p>
The old man sank back, with a long
and gentle sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Then I die contented, and reassured.
Re&mdash;"  His voice weakened again.
Then he rallied, for a final effort:
</p>

<p>
"I have lived respected, I think!"
</p>

<p>
That was all.
</p>

<p>
I looked across to Ada, and nodded.
Characteristically, she rose from her
knees, crossed to the window, and drew
down the blind.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
VIII
</h3>

<p>
Next morning, Ada Weeks and I sat
facing one another in my study, across
a newly opened packing-case.  It
contained Mr. Baxter's Library.
</p>

<p>
"But why must we?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"We needn't worry why.  He said
every blessed book was to be destroyed,
and that's all there is about it.
Mr. McAndrew is burning rubbish outside:
I've told him we've got some more for
him.  Let's get it over, and go back to
Grampa&mdash;sir," concluded Ada suddenly,
remembering somewhat tardily that
she was addressing her employer.
</p>

<p>
We unpacked the books.  First came
some musty theological tomes.
</p>

<p>
"He knew a lot out of them," remarked
Ada.  "Used to fire it off at the
Rector, and people who didn't believe in
religion, or couldn't.  He picked it all up
from his old Archdeacon, though, long
before I came to him."
</p>

<p>
"When did you come, by the way?"
</p>

<p>
"Nearly six years ago now.  I was
living with an aunt.  She went and died
when I was nine, and Grampa sent for
me here.  It was me that learned him all
his new stuff&mdash;science, and machinery,
and aeroplanes, and things like that.
He didn't know nothink but Latin and
Greek and history and things up till then.
Here's the Cyclopædia coming out now.
He never used it till I come.  He never
even knew it was four volumes short
until I told him....  This next lot is
mostly little books he picked up cheap
at second-hand places&mdash;mouldy little
things, most of 'em.  Some of them were
useful, though.  Here's one&mdash;'The
Amateur Architect.'  It's queer how
fussy people can be about house-planning,
and ventilation, and drainage, and
things like that, especially when they
know they've got to live all their lives in
a house where they have no more say in
the ventilation and drainage than my
aunt's cat!  Grampa had to learn nearly
the whole of this book, they wanted so
many different bits of it.  Well, I think
we have fuel enough now for a start."
</p>

<p>
We staggered into the garden, with
arms full, to where McAndrew's bonfire
was burning fiercely.  McAndrew
himself, having regard to his chronic
interest in other people's business, I had
despatched upon an errand.  Soon the
Encyclopædia and the theological works
were engulfed in flame.  Some odd
volumes followed.  I cremated my old friend
Robert Southey with my own hands.
This done, we returned to the
packing-case and delved again.
</p>

<p>
"Did Mr. Baxter wish everything
to be burned?" I asked.  "What about
the presentation volumes&mdash;the
Shakespeare, for instance?"
</p>

<p>
"They was <i>all</i> to be burned,"
announced Ada doggedly, lowering her head
into the case and avoiding my glance.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," I said.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Ada looked up again, fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"Cross your heart and wish you may
die if you look inside one of them!" she
commanded.
</p>

<p>
I meekly took the grisly oath.  But
chance was too strong for us.  Ada,
eager to keep me entirely aloof from the
mystery, attempted to lift four large
volumes out of the case at once.  The
top volume&mdash;the Presentation Shakespeare
itself&mdash;slipped off the others,
fell upon the floor, and lay upon its back
wide open.  I could not help observing
that it was a London Telephone Directory.
</p>

<p>
For a moment Ada and I regarded
one another steadily.  She did not wink
an eyelash.  Indeed, it was I who felt
guilty.
</p>

<p>
"I may as well see them all now," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Please yourself," said Ada coldly.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was a strange collection.  There
were three Telephone Directories in all&mdash;all
old friends of mine, and peculiarly
adapted, from their size and dignity, for
"Presentation" purposes.  (I think they
were Shakespeare, Milton, and Dante.
The Presentation Tennyson, however,
proved to be a Bulb Catalogue.)  There
was a Hall and Knight's Algebra, from
which, in my presence, the old man had
frequently and most movingly quoted
Keats.  Homer, as Pettigrew had correctly
indicated, was an elementary
German grammar.  Plato's Apology was
Mr. Chardenal's First French Course.
</p>

<p>
"He used to get them cheaper than
the real ones," explained Ada.  "Besides,
what did it matter to him, anyhow?"
</p>

<p>
What indeed?  Poor old boy!
</p>

<p>
I worked through the whole collection&mdash;the
miscellaneous flotsam of second-hand
bookshops and jumble sales&mdash;old
novels sold in bundles; old directories
sold as waste paper.  Every book
was neatly covered, and decorated with
a sprawling number&mdash;the sight of
which, although it advertised nothing
to the outside world but the position of
a book on a shelf, had never failed, for
more than thirty years, to switch on the
right record in that amazing repertoire.
</p>

<p>
Idly, I picked out the last book in the
box.  It was a stumpy little volume,
bearing the number Twenty-Five.
</p>

<p>
"That's 'Orace," said Ada promptly.
"It's a real one&mdash;in Latin: only it has
the English on the opposite page.  We
used that a lot."
</p>

<p>
I turned over the time-soiled leaves,
and my eye encountered a familiar
passage.  I looked up.
</p>

<p>
"I think he would have liked to have
a small inscription on the coffin," I said.
"We can arrange it when we go back to
the house.  There's a line here that seems
to me to describe him very accurately."
</p>

<p>
"Read it," said Ada.  I did so:
</p>

<p class="poem">
"<i>Of upright life, and stainless purity.</i>"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Yes; he was all that," said Ada
thoughtfully.  "Never done nothink on
nobody; and always the gentleman.  It
will look nice on the plate.  How does it
go in Latin?"
</p>

<p>
I read aloud the ancient tag.
</p>

<p class="poem">
"<i>Integer vitæ, scelerisque purus&mdash;</i>"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Ada nodded her head vigorously.
</p>

<p>
"Put it in Latin," she said.  "He'd
have liked it that way.  Besides, it'll
learn Mould and Pettigrew, and that lot!"
</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
